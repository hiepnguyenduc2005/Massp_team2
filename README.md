Detecting fake news on social media is a critical task to ensure information integrity. While there are several studies about fake news detection on English information, Vietnamese fake news detection remains limited. In this research, we propose an approach for Vietnamese fake news using pre-trained models for word tokenization combined with word embedding inside 2 layers Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory

Network. Our proposed model is trained and evaluated on the dataset of Reliable Intelligence Identification on Vietnamese SNSs (ReINTEL), which contains nearly 10000 examples with labels. Our experiments on the dataset demonstrate promising results with an accuracy of 0.9583 and an F1 score of

0.8684 using wor tokenization from the Bartpho model, demonstrating our modelâ€™s effectiveness in detecting false news articles in Vietnamese.
